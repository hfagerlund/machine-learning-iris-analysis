# machine-learning-iris-analysis

This project is a work in progress, preparing to build a machine learning classifier in Python.

So far, data is loaded, described and visualized (somewhat).

Future plans include the addition of:
* (a) supervised learning algorithm(s),
* model(s), and
* predictions.

## Requirements

* Python v3.7.0
* Jupyter Notebook server v5.6.0
  * IPython v6.5.0
* Iris flowers dataset (included with [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn))
